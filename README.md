# Road-Representation
This repository provides tools to simplify road network geometries and represent their topology in different forms, based on **arcpy** and **geopandas**.

# Usage
1. Configure **geopandas** within the ArcGIS Python environment.
2. Prepare your road network dataset (e.g., from OpenStreetMap<https://www.openstreetmap.org>).  
3. Run the scripts to process the road network. An example is provided in the `main` function.
